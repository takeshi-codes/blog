title: About Me
---

A page about me on my website created by me. Neato.

I'm Dylan, a full stack web developer, with a little solutions architecture and frontend sprinkled in there too. I'm pretty into working with Ruby on Rails. You can also find me using tools like Node, React, and Angular. Also
like cloud stuff, specifically AWS and Fly.io, and occassionally Firebase or Supabase.

Most of my keyboard time is spent honing my skills with Ruby and JavaScript. I really like to push the limits of things and find out what makes stuff tick. I plan on using this blog to talk about my thoughts on Ruby, JS, and developer productivity. Not sure if I want to dip my toes into the tutorial world, there's a lot of really good tutorials out there. For now, I'm just getting my thoughts out and into the world.

Outside of computer-y stuff, I'm learning Japanese. Learning a new language has been pretty fun, especially one so vastly different than English. Also pretty into Nintendo games, drinking and brewing beer, and hanging out with my dog.
