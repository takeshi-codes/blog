A page about me on my website created by me. Neato. 

Hello, my name is Dylan, and I'm a full-stack web developer experienced in solutions architecture and front-end development. I work mostly with Ruby on Rails, but I've also done a fair amount of work with Node.js, React, Angular, AWS, Fly.io, and sometimes even Firebase or Supabase. I just love experimenting with cloud technologies and keep on increasing my skill set to keep up with modern web development. Most of my time is spent bettering my skills in Ruby and JavaScript. I live for pushing the limits of what's possible and learning how things work under the hood. 

Outside of development, I’m immersing myself in learning Japanese, which has been an exciting challenge, especially considering the language’s unique structure compared to English. I’m also an avid fan of Nintendo games, enjoy and tasting brewing beer, and cherish time spent with my dog, Potter.
