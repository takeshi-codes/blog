title: About Me
---

A page about me on my website created by me. Neato.

I'm currently a web developer looking for work. Need somebody to do some magic with Rails or React? Hit me up, dgreen@hey.com

I like doing web development, I'm pretty into working with Ruby on Rails. You
can also find me using tools like Node, React, MongoDB, and Next.js. Also
like cloud stuff, specifically AWS and Fly.io, and occassionally Firebase or Supabase.

Outside of computer-y stuff, I like to watch anime and read manga, attempting to learn Japanese too. Also pretty into
Nintendo games, playing bass, and hanging out with my dog. You can
find pictures of him on my Twitter, he's a good boy.
