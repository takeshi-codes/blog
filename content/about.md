title: About Me
---

A page about me on my website created by me. Neato.

I'm Dylan, a full stack web developer, with a little solutions architecture and frontend sprinkled in there too. I'm pretty into working with Ruby on Rails. You
can also find me using tools like Node, React, MongoDB, and Next.js. Also
like cloud stuff, specifically AWS and Fly.io, and occassionally Firebase or Supabase.

Most of my keyboard time is spent honing my skills with Ruby and JavaScript. I really like to push the limits of things and find out what makes stuff tick. I plan on using this blog to talk about anything and everything Ruby and Rails related.

Outside of computer-y stuff, I like to watch anime and read manga, attempting to learn Japanese too. Also pretty into Nintendo games, playing bass, and hanging out with my dog. You can
find pictures of him on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thisisdylandev), he's a good boy.
