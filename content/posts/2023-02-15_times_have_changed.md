Hey there, long time no chat. Guess what? Ya know how every company is doing layoffs right now? Yep, I got caught up in it. My time at BARK was nothing but fantastic, and I learned so much while I was there. Even made a couple friends too. Yeah it sucks I got laid off, but sometimes it just really be like that. Doors close, and new doors open. Now I'm just trying to find where that new door is going to lead me.

So, I took a few days as "me days" which may or may not have involved alcohol and three different anime. And now, I'm on the job hunt. I'm pretty solidified in my career as a web dev, really like React and Rails. I'm taking my newlyfound downtime to hone those skills, and maybe pick up another one or two while I'm at it... like go? I don't know, maybe rust.

I also remembered I have this blog, so I guess now is a good time to get around to updating it and using it again. Now I just gotta think of things to blog about. 

That's all for now, see ya! ðŸ‘‹
