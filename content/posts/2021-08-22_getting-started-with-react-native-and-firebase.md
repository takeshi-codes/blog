Hello, it's me, I've been wondering if after all these months of not posting, you'd still like to read my blog.

K now that that is out of the way, Hello again! Haven't posted in a while (what's new?), but hey, this whole blogging thing can be hard sometimes. Consistency is key, and for whatever reason, I just don't post consistently enough.

So anyways, I got that ol' itch to build again, so this time, I'm using React Native ⚛️ & Firebase 🔥 to build a mobile app! I'm building out an app for managing & coordinating rugby teams, because that's a thing I play now. Honestly, I know I've posted recently kinda being down on JavaScript, but React Native was so fun, and at the end of the day, I have the most fun in dev when I'm working on mobile apps.

I'm going to try to post frequently as I get to work on this app, and detail out the steps of how I made it, and how you too can build an app with React Native 😄

First things first, I bootstrapped the repo using the [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). After that, I updated the README following along with the super awesome [readme.so](readme.so). 

Secondly, I added [Firebase using using Yarn](https://rnfirebase.io/), set up my credentials in a `.env` file, and configured the app following along with the instructions from the react-native-firebase site.

After I verified all of that was running properly, I set up all of my fun developer experience tools: eslint, prettier, and husky. These can be pretty opiniated, so I recommend that you find what settings you like the most 👍

Lastly, I opted to use TypeScript...... _after_ I done all of that, so I followed the [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript) to add that in.

You can follow along with the development [in my GitHub](https://github.com/thisisdylandev/sevensandfifteens)

Something I'm very excited to try out with this project is Jest. I've done a good bit of testing with Rails/Ruby, but never much with JavaScript, so I'm going to be trying my best to add lots and lots of meaningful tests to this app.

Well, that's all for now 👋
