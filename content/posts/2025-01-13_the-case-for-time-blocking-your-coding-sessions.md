title: "The Case For Time-Blocking Your Coding Sessions"
---

In the fast-paced world of software development, it is always challenging to focus and be productive. Easy distractions come from meetings, code reviews, emails, and spontaneous interruptions that make your day difficult to look at and fit little room for deep, uninterrupted work. That is where time-blocking is a very good productivity tool. Schedule your blocks of coding time so you have head space to really concentrate on work and avoid derailments that derail the progress.

Time-blocking lets you take control of your schedule instead of your schedule controlling you. Reserving specific chunks of your day for focused work signals to yourself and others that this time is sacred for development. It makes it a lot easier to say no to interruptions or unwanted meetings, thereby helping you set some clear boundaries. The structure tends to make one work with purpose; you are bound to approach each task with intent when you realize that your time is limited. Over time, it can lead to big productivity increases and stress relief as more deliberate sessions result.

Another good impact of time-blocking is against burnout. Working for hours straight without taking a break makes one feel very productive in the short term but results in lower quality and mental exhaustion. Schedule breaks into your time-blocks so that you keep energy and concentration all day long. A short walk, stretch, or getting away from the screen altogether can be just the refresh the mind needs to help the creative juices flow. By the use of time-blocking, you increase quality in work and achieve better relations with the calendar, allowing for sustainable productivity in the long term.
