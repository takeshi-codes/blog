description: "I be going through it"

Typically, I try to keep the posts here about tech, the web, or other things in my professional life. However, I'm still human. For once, I have a decent reason for not updating my blog or work on my "building in public" app. I've decided to put a pause on all of my side projects, and focus on work. Whenever I do pick back up on working on side projects, I'm probably going to go back to ol' faithful, Ruby on Rails with some React sprinkled in.

I'm not one to share personal details like this on the internet, but there's some catharsis with just getting emotions put out in the open. So I plan on just rambling a bit here.

Recently, my father passed away. It's been rough, and honestly in my downtime, I've been spending more and more time away from screens. It's been nice, focusing on being with my family, my wife, and working on other hobbies like rugby to stay busy. I'm been slightly active on Twitter still, but that's mostly to distract myself. I'll probably be inactive on this blog for a while, and I plan on updating the 7's & 15's mobile app repo to reflect that it's not currently being worked on. For the forseeable future, I plan on just doing what I've been doing and spending more time with my family.

And honestly, I recommend you do the same. Pick up the phone and call somebody, take your dogs on a walk, enjoy the small things. Hell, I even checked my niece out of school early for an anime/movie evening and it was the most fun I've had in a long time. There's more to life than just coding and tech, enjoy it.

Well, that's all for now. I'm gonna have a margarita and watch Netflix with my dogs now. I'm not sure when I'll feel up to updating this blog again, so in the meantime, see ya eventually ðŸ‘‹
