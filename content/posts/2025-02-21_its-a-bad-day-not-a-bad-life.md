Well, it's official, I'm back in the job market. Much like many of my peers nowadays, I got caught up in layoffs. They're an unfortunate reality, and it sucks both emotionally and professionally. First there's the overwhelming shock, then the uptick in motivation to apply apply apply to everything and everything. Then the rejections come in. That, to me, is the roughest part. No matter the reason -budget cuts, restructuring- you start to ask questions, "Was I not good at my job?", "Am I in the right field?", "Why me?". And that's where I'm at right now.

I'm just trying to take this time to process, assess myself, and improve any and everywhere I can. I'm coming to terms that it was just a business decision, albeit and unfortunate one. 

Things I'm working on in the tech world and adjacent.... improving my JS, working more on this blog, finding a side project I'm passionate about, making a portfolio. Working on making a plan of action to tackle how I'm going to get back on my feet as soon as possible. Spending more time learning Japanese, more time with my wife and dogs, just trying to do more of the things I know I enjoy.

If you've every dealt with these feelings, I've got an ear for you. Just remember, it's a bad day, not a bad life. Layoffs aren't easy, but you never know where you're going to land next. Sometimes something out of your control, like a layoff, is the catalyst to the next big thing.

I don't know, honestly I'm just rambling here. Not a typical post for the good ole OnTheRails, but here I am. Hope you enjoyed the conciousness, not really proofreading this post.
